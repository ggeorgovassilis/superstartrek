<h2><a id="mission_chapter">Mission briefing</a></h2>
<p>
Stardate 2100 - the rivalry between Klingon houses has reached our door step. In an attempt to project
dominance, numerous Klingon war ships have crossed into Federation space, involving our forces in skirmishes. 
Your orders are to seek out and neutralize as many Klingons as you can. All star bases in the quadrant have
been put on yellow alert and ordered to assist you with repairs, if necessary.</p>

<h2>Tactical briefing</h2>
<p>Klingon war ships are armed with <em>disruptors</em>, powerful energy weapons which can destroy unprotected targets.
Furthermore, Klingon ships possess stealth capabilities, which allows them to move undetected. Cloaks, while active,
emit a radiation signature which short range sensors pick up and incorporate into the tactical report.
</p>
<p><em>Klingon raiders c-}</em> are small vessels carrying light armament. A single raider poses no threat 
to the Enterprise, but swarms of them can quickly disable a ship's defenses.
</p>
<p>The <em>Bird-of-Prey C-D</em> is the backbone of the Empire's war fleet. They are roughly equivalent in power to 
the Constitution class, albeit slower.</p>

<h2><a id="helm_chapter_chapter">The Helm</a></h2>
<p>
The helm is the main command station on the bridge of this vessel. It executes navigation commands, carries out battle instructions  
and produces status reports. The main screen displays a comprehensive overview of the current quadrant.
The short range sensors (SRS) shows the number of stars, star bases and Klingon vessels in neighboring quadrants.
The long range sensors (LRS) shows the same information (where available) for the entire Alpha quadrant.

<h2><a id="navigation_chapter">Navigation</a></h2>
<p>
The <em>impulse drive</em> propels your vessel in a quadrant. Mark a sector in the quadrant and issue a navigation order to move
to that sector.
</p>
<p>
The <em>warp drive</em> moves your vessel by large distances. Mark a quadrant either in the SRS or LRS and issue a navigation order
to warp to the target quadrant. Enemy vessels might obstruct warp travel.

<h2><a id="combat_chapter">Combat</a></h2>
<p>Short range sensor readings can trigger a yellow alert when the presence of enemy vessels is detected in the quadrant or even a
red alert, if enemy ships are in the immediate vicinity. 
</p>
<p>
The Enterprise is armed with phasers and photon torpedos which can be fired at enemy vessels. 
Phasers consume energy, attenuate over distance and are most effective when fired from close range. The Enterprise is equipped with
a limited number of photon torpedos. While not limited in range, their slow speed gives enemy vessels space for evasive
maneuvers. Photon torpedos are most effective at close range against targets with low shielding.
</p>
<p>The ship's tactical computer aims phasers at targets quicker than manual operators, allowing simultaneous operation of phasers
and torpedos. Under certain circumstances it might be advisable to deactivate automatic aim.</p>
<p>
Energy <em>shields</em> protect the Enterprise from enemy fire. They consume energy and suffer damage when absorbing blasts. Shields are
effective against single enemies but break down under concerted fire. Enemy fire which penetrates the Enterprise's shields
can damage the ship's systems.

<h2><a id="repairs_chapter">Refueling and Repairs</a></h2>
<p>
The main reactor uses anti matter to power among other things propulsion, shields and weapons. Each activity consumes anti matter
which can be replenished at Federation star bases. In order to refuel and repair your ship, locate a star base on the LRS, warp to
it's quadrant. When you have arrived in the quadrant, locate the star base in the quadrant and navigate next to it. Finally issue the
<em>Dock in star base</em> helm order.
